# attacking
- group up before fighting if possible
- avoid undocked enemies

# defending
- block path to docked ships

# spreading
- change spread for 4-maps so it does not inverse gain,
  but instead spread to regions with a single warfront
- actually calculate time till return regarding distance

# general
- build actual shortest paths for navigation
- check crossing vectors for collision
