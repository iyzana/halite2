# attacking
- group up before fighting if possible
- maybe circumvent undocked ships for sneak attacks

# defending
- block path to docked ships

# spreading
- change spread for 4-maps so it does not inverse gain,
  but instead spread to regions with a single warfront
- actually calculate time till return regarding distance
- increase spread score if we're not highest on production

# general
- build actual shortest paths for navigation
- check crossing vectors for collision
